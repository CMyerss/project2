Were you able to reach their endpoint on the web?
    can you successfully make requests and receive responses from all of their endpoints?
        - All endpoints function as intended, except the GET for a specific type of champion, unless I've misunderstood the intended functionality.
What did you like about this service?
    - I like how accesible it is. The endpoints are intuitive and efficient with no redundant endpoint parameters for the inteded functionality.
What do you think about the paths that have been chosen?
    are they consistent? is there any possible point of confusion?
        - I like the paths that have been chosen, they are consistent with no points of confusion.
What do you like about the structure of the responses from the different endpoints?
    - I like that they fulfill all possible needs of someone that would consider using this API.
Describe one significant difference between your own P2 service and this person's. E.g.
    Which might be easier to build a front end for (and why)?
        - I'm not sure we would notice a difference in the front end relationship for either of our APIs, since I'm not sure the structure of our responses really differ in terms of usability or quality.
    Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
        - While I might not see a difference in building a front end, this codebase definitely seems easier to maintain. It has clean abstraction through functions and well commented 
Is the code well-structured?
    if not, suggest some specific improvements
        - This code is well-structured, I can't think of any specific improvements beyond simply implementing more endpoints.
Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    - Like I mentioned in the first question, my tests of the GETs for type didn't work.
Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    might they want to consider adding any endpoint(s) to better facilitate a particular front end feature you're imagining?
        - Endpoints to implement some way to store image URLs associated with champions maybe?
    might they be able to include more or less of the data in the response to an endpoint and better support the front end?
        - I think they could definitely include more data in the response to the front end, but implementing that should not be difficult and the code they have now is a good demonstration that they know how to do it.
